3. We intially tried to do this through a server client, without taking advatange of fxml. This 
allowed us to run a unit test that showed a live server that could respond to messages. This then 
fitting into our architecture design that where the storybox fucntions as a backend that is locked 
and synced to all of the screens.  After going over the design document again we wanted to make
sure that we were incorperating some kind of UI change as well.  I used some online tutorials so 
that I could get a handle of how to grab information from an FXML screen and broad cast it by setting
up a main that grabs the fxml document (app) and then a controller that validates the change by
checking the field, and then sending an update alert in a seperate window

4. In an effort to do record locking, we hope to have a synced version of the backend that carries
a flag on each story.  This way if that flag is on, it's state can be edited by the other users until
the file is refreshed, edits made, and the flag is turned off by the user after editing
